# Environmental Dashboard

## Overview
The Environmental Dashboard is a web-based platform designed to provide real-time data and insights on key environmental indicators. It offers a range of features and visualizations to help users understand and address critical environmental issues.

## Features
- **Homepage:** A visually appealing homepage with an environmental-themed background image.
- **Navigation:** An easy-to-use navigation bar for quick access to different sections.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Displaying real-time data on critical metrics:
  - Global CO2 Emissions
  - Number of Endangered Species
  - Primary Forest Loss
  - Global Temperature Rise
- **Data Visualizations:** Four essential data visualizations:
  - CO2 Emissions Bar Chart
  - Land Proportion Scatterplot
  - Endangered Species Table
  - Threatened Species Trends Line Chart
  - Forest Cover Land Pie Chart
  - Threatened Plant spiece Chloropleth map
  - CO2 Emissions Proportional Symbol map
  - Arable Land Dot map
- **Color Scheme:** A harmonious green color scheme symbolizing environmental themes.
